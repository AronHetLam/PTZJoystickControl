## Linux and RaspberryPi support
The application also runs on Linux, and even a RaspberryPi, however I haven't got to releasing binaries for those yet.
On x86 and x64 Linux machienes you can build from source using ¬¥dotnet build¬¥, and it should be able to run.
For linux-ARM devices such as RaspberryPi you additionally need to compile libSDL2 yourself, and add it to the build output for it to run.
